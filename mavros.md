# MAVROS and PX4 Flight Stack

## Frame Convention

The architecture lineage of MAVROS and PX4 led to the adoption of differing frame convention. MAVROS, a MAVLink-ROS interface, adopts the land vehicle ENU frame convention commonly and PX4 adopts the aeronautical NED frame convention. The detailed illustration of the frame convention between ROS and PX4 can be found in [PX4 Developer Wiki](https://dev.px4.io/en/ros/external_position_estimation.html#asserting-on-reference-frames).
